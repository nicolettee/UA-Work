                    <h3>Nice to meet you!</h3>
                    <p> Hi. My name, if you couldn't tell, is Nicolette Taylor. My goal with this site is to help you get to
                        know me.</p>
                    <p> I love a challenge. And I pride myself on being able to load the van more efficiently than my husband
                        when we go camping.</p>
                    <p> I know this content will change over time as my skills develop, but for now it's the little things that
                        count.
                    </p>
                    <p>It's rather corny, but one of my favorite motivational quotes is the lyrics "Get Back Up Again" from The Trolls movie.</p>
                    <p>"I'm marching along, I got confidence.
                            I'm cooler than a pack of peppermints.
                            And I haven't been this excited since
                            I can't remember when!</p>
                    <p>I'm off on this remarkable adventure,
                            Just riding on a rainbow.
                            What if it's all a big mistake?
                            What if it's more than I can take?
                            No, I can't think that way. 'cause I know that
                            I'm really really gonna be okay"</p>
